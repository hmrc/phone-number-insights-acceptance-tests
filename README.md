This repository contains api acceptance tests for the Phone Number Insights service built using the [api-test-runner](https://github.com/hmrc/api-test-runner) library.

## Running the tests

Prior to executing the tests ensure you have:

- Installed/configured [sm2 (service manager 2)](https://github.com/hmrc/sm2).
- Postgres DB installed locally or running in Docker.

### Start the local services

If you don't have mongodb installed locally you can run it in docker using the following commands:

```bash
    docker run --rm -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo percona/percona-server-mongodb:7.0
```

If you don't have postgres installed locally you can run it in docker using the following command

```bash
    docker run -d --rm --name postgresql -e POSTGRES_DB=phonenumberinsights -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres:latest
```
